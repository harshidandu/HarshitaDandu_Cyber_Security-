# 🛡️ Mini SOC Analyst Lab Project

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In_Progress-blue)

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a fully functional **mini Security Operations Center (SOC)** environment from scratch.  
It uses the **ELK Stack** for centralized log management and visualization, **Mythic** for simulating command and control (C2) activity, and **OS Ticket** for alert tracking and ticket management.

The goal is to simulate real-world SOC workflows, enhance detection capabilities, and build strong hands-on cybersecurity skills.

---

## Objectives

- Set up a complete mini SOC environment.
- Deploy and configure the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Deploy a **Mythic C2 server** to simulate cyber attacks.
- Integrate **OS Ticket** to manage and track alerts.
- Create custom **alerts and dashboards** in Kibana.
- Simulate attacks to **generate telemetry** and practice detection.
- Build an understanding of how SOC components interact.
