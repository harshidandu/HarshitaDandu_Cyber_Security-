# 🛡️ Malware Analysis Lab

---

## 🎯 Objective

The Malware Analysis project aimed to build a comprehensive lab environment for performing static and dynamic analysis on malicious software samples.

The primary goal was to safely inspect malware behavior, identify attack signatures, and understand persistence mechanisms within an isolated virtual machine environment.  
This practical experience enhanced proficiency in cybersecurity practices, specifically in malware detection, analysis, and defensive response.
